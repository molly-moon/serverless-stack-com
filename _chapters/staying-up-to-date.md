We made this guide open source to make sure that the content is kept up to date and accurate with the help of the community. We are also adding new chapters based on the needs of the community and the feedback we receive.

To help people stay up to date with the changes, we run the <a href="{{ site.newsletter_signup_form }}" target="_blank">Serverless Stack newsletter</a>. The newsletter is a:

- Short plain text email
- Outlines the recent updates to Serverless Stack
- Never sent out more than once a week
- One click unsubscribe
- And you get the entire guide as a 1000 page eBook

You can also <a target="_blank" href="{{ site.twitter_url }}">follow us on Twitter</a>.

<a class="button contact" href="{{ site.newsletter_signup_form }}" target="_blank">Subscribe</a>
